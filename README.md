Create, document, and train a model that recognises hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset. This should be done using the keras and jupyter Python packages, and this part is worth 40%. : Create a web application that allows a user to draw a digit using their mouse or touchscreen device. The drawing should then be then be submitted for recognition to the model you have trained above. This should be done using the flask Python package and is also worth 40%.
