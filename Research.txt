Why do we need to create a python virtual environment? 
Python programs often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. 
These packages may have several release versions. So, quite often we might find ourselves in situations 
where one of the running applications might need a package of one version while the other needs the same 
package but of a different version. This will lead to conflicts. To solve this conflict, we need python 
virtual environment.
